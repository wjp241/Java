# Java

# Overall Process(Coding-to-Running)

1. Compilation
   - Developer writes a human-readable program in .java file.
   - Compiler compiles .java file to a machine-readable bytecode file in a .class format.   
   - Compilation catches mistakes before computer does any execution at all.
2. Interpretation & Execution
   - Java virtual machine executes the bytecode file OS independently.

# public static void main(string args[]) Explanation

#### Public

- Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class(If other Classes can access this  Class).

#### Static

- It means the  given Method or variable is Class related, not instance related. It  can be accessed without creating a Class instance.

#### Void

- It defines what the  method can return. Void means the Method will not return any value.

#### main

- This Method name is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application.

#### String args[] / Stringâ€¦ args

- It is the parameter to the main method. The argument name could be anything.

## Casting(Data Type Transformation)

- Manual casting is necessary:
  - from larger to smaller

- Automatic casting is possible:
  - from smaller data type to larger data type
  - but NOT, from larger to smaller

#### Example,

    - Data Size relationship
         byte < short < int < long < float < double
         (1)      (2)      (4)   (8)     (4)      (8)
         char < int < long < float < double
         (2)      (4)   (8)     (4)      (8)
       
       l-value = r-value
       
       double = int
       long = char
       int = (int)double   
       char = (char)int
       int = int   --> int
       long = long --> long
       float = float --> float
       int = double --> double
       int = char  --> int
       int = long  --> long
       long = float  --> float
       
       v1 + v2 = ?
    
       int   int --> int
       long long --> long
       float float --> float
       int   double --> double
       int   char  --> int
       int   long  --> long
       long  float  --> float
       char  char  --> int


### Variable Declaration&&Loops (For/While)

- declare variables outside of scopes

  #### Why?
  - to prevent extra declaration in every loop

# OOP

### Methods

#### Static(Class) vs Instance Method

-  Static methods are methods that are in the scope of a class. These methods can be accessed via ClassA.methodB syntax. 

  ** Static methods can be accessed by both static methods and instance methods.

##### Now what about Instance methods?

- Instance methods can be accessed *ONLY* by instance methods! Class(static) methods do not have access to instance methods.

***Why?*** This is because class methods ***do not have reference*** to instance methods, unlike the vice versa!

# Overloading

Okay, **overloading** is when a class has multiple method with the same name!

- overloading is possible when the methods have different number or type of parameters!
- If parameters have same number and type of parameters but ***have different name***s, this is **not overloading**!

# Constructor

Okay, what is constructor

- constructor is a method responsible for initializing the members (variables(attributes) and methods) of instance.
- this method is invoked when instantiation begins with the keyword "new".
- it must be:
  - named the same as the class name!
  - have no void attached, even though it returns nothing since it only initializes!
- Cool Facts
  - it's possible to have multiple constructors
  - when one constructor calls another constructor, it must be done with this keyword like this: 
    - this(type var, type var2)...
